# AdventOfCode 2020

This year, I may do a couple of tasks from [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Rust.

I debated doing Go, but currently doing a REST api for work, I think Go will make me not appreciate Rust anymore. I want to stay ignorant for a few months more to keep motivation up.

This project is using more or less a Framework called [cargo-aoc](https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-aoc) which is an extension to Rust package manager "cargo".

## Installation

Install Rust. It's recommended to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for that task. It can manage the Rust-Installation(s) fairly easy using the "rustup" command.

After installing rustup install Rust with it. Whether you choose stable or nightly probably doesn't matter. I use nightly out of habit for other projects. Command: `rustup install nightly`

After this you should have the command "cargo" and can install cargo-aoc: `cargo install cargo-aoc`. This will add the subcommand "aoc" to cargo.

Next, clone this repo and cd into it.

Now you can run any days solutions using `cargo aoc -d <DAY> (-p <1/2>)`. Benchmarks can be run using `cargo aoc -d <DAY> bench`.

## Benches

So far, these are the timings of solving the puzzles on my Ryzen 3700X CPU:

Note: The implementation of Part 1 was not optimized meaningfully. It could be optimized by either passing along a "contains cache" or recursing up from children.

### Day 8

<summary>7.4us + 172.9us</summary>

| Part | Min       | Avg       | Max       | Note                             |

Notes:

- Using [rayon](https://lib.rs/rayon)s into_par_iter() function made the test run aprox 5 times faster on my Ryzen 3700X.
  Copying the instructions for every loop didn't introduce a noticable performance penalty even without parallelization.
